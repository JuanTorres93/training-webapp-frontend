To prevent DDoS attacks in your React app with an Express backend, here are several strategies you can implement:
1. Rate Limiting

Implement rate limiting to restrict the number of requests a user can make in a certain time period. This can help mitigate DDoS attacks by limiting the number of requests that can overload your server.

You can use the express-rate-limit middleware:

bash

npm install express-rate-limit

Example usage in Express:

js

const rateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');

const limiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 100, // limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
  message: "Too many requests, please try again later."
});

app.use(limiter);

This will limit requests to 100 per 15 minutes from a single IP.
2. Reverse Proxy (e.g., NGINX)

Set up a reverse proxy, such as NGINX, to handle traffic and filter out bad actors. It can help to offload traffic from your server and block common DDoS patterns.

Example NGINX configuration:

nginx

http {
  limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=one:10m rate=10r/s;

  server {
    location / {
      limit_req zone=one burst=5;
    }
  }
}

This limits incoming traffic to 10 requests per second, with a burst allowance of 5.
3. Firewall and IP Blocking

Configure firewalls to block malicious IP addresses. Some cloud services offer firewall protection (e.g., AWS, GCP). Additionally, you can block or allow IP ranges at the server level.

In Express, you can block specific IPs using custom middleware:

js

const blockedIPs = ['192.168.0.1'];

app.use((req, res, next) => {
  if (blockedIPs.includes(req.ip)) {
    return res.status(403).send('Your IP is blocked');
  }
  next();
});

4. Use a CDN (Content Delivery Network)

A CDN like Cloudflare, Akamai, or Fastly can distribute traffic across multiple servers globally, making it harder for attackers to focus on a single point. Cloudflare also offers free DDoS protection services.
5. Increase Server Resources

Scale your server's resources (CPU, RAM) to handle temporary traffic spikes, especially if you're on cloud services like AWS or Heroku. This can provide a buffer during an attack until you implement rate limiting or block the attack.
6. Logging and Monitoring

Set up proper logging and monitoring using services like New Relic, Datadog, or even PM2 for Express apps. This will help you detect unusual traffic patterns and identify potential threats early.
7. CAPTCHA

Implement a CAPTCHA (e.g., Google reCAPTCHA) on your critical endpoints (such as login or signup forms) to ensure that only real users can make requests.

Example:

html

<form action="/signup" method="POST">
  <div class="g-recaptcha" data-sitekey="your_site_key"></div>
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>

And on the backend, verify the CAPTCHA response with Google.
