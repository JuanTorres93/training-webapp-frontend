  "niche-section-title": "Your mindset",
  "niche-1-title": " Guaranteed results if ...",
  "niche-1-reason-1": " You're willing to leave excuses behind.",
  "niche-1-explanation-1": " The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results. We are what we do, and if we want change, we have to change our actions.",
  "niche-1-reason-2": " You feel you deserve a better life.",
  "niche-1-explanation-2": " You've been feeling dissatisfied with yourself long enough and you know it's time to take action. Training and taking care of yourself is one of the best investments you're going to make in your life. Starting to work on your body and treating it with the respect it deserves is a big step towards a fulfilling life.",
  "niche-1-reason-3": " You want your insecurity not to limit you",
  "niche-1-explanation-3": " Feeling insecure is something normal and that happens to all of us with some area in our life. By taking the reins of our health, we are proving to ourselves that we are capable of doing what is good for us. This simple fact expands to the rest of the areas of our lives, giving us the confidence to do things that we previously considered impossible for us.",
  "niche-1-reason-4": " You value a system that guarantees progress",
  "niche-1-explanation-4": " Anything that can be measured can be improved. Achieving your fitness goals is not only not different, but it's simple if you know how to do it. You just have to train a little harder in each session, eat correctly and rest well. Trackoverload facilitates the measurement process so you can clearly see how you're progressing.",
  "niche-2-title": "You'll change your mind if ...",
  "niche-2-reason-1": " You're afraid of people's judgment",
  "niche-2-explanation-1": " The criticisms we believe we can receive from our close environment can limit our ability to take action. If we have low self-esteem, we may perceive that people are going to laugh at us for wanting to change our situation. It may even be embarrassing to admit that we want to look fit or lose a few pounds. There's no need to be ashamed of it, wanting to look your best is in human nature.",
  "niche-2-reason-2": "Deep inside you feel this is not for you",
  "niche-2-explanation-2": " There's a belief that people who exercise simply do it because they're superficial and want to show off. In reality, exercise is an important part of good health in anyone. In addition, it has positive effects on mental health and helps us maintain a better quality of life for many years. Lastly, it's not necessary to dedicate a large amount of time per week to have its benefits.",
  "niche-2-reason-3": " You've tried before and always failed",
  "niche-2-explanation-3": " One of the biggest reasons people stop training is not seeing results immediately. The key to being consistent is to measure all the victories we make. Always doing one more repetition than in the previous workout or lifting a little more weight is progress that can be easily seen. The key to success is to consistently follow a system that works.",
  "niche-2-reason-4": " You believe you're not capable of making a change.",
  "niche-2-explanation-4": " You want to start training, you've even researched it and know its benefits, but you think it's too hard work for you. Here the secret is in adapting the routines to you, not in adapting yourself to the routines. Many times we see that they give us a fixed number of repetitions or weight to use that, simply, for us may be too much. We have to play within a range that challenges us and makes us grow, but doesn't make us feel miserable.",
  "features-section-title": "You execute, we guarantee...",
  "feature-1-title": "More rest than exercise",
  "feature-1-description": "Science sais that rest is crucial for muscle growth. Different studies suggest rest times of 1 - 5 minutes between sets. Choose the most suitable for you.",
  "feature-2-title": "Progress from 2nd week",
  "feature-2-description": "One of the main reasons people quit is because they don't see results. Tracking your progress is essential to know you're in the right path. It ensures you're getting closer to your goal.",
  "feature-3-title": "Simple and tested free workouts",
  "feature-3-description": "Free workouts designed to be performed at home. Little equipment needed. Optimized for strenghten the whole body and take the least amount of time possible.",
  "feature-4-title": "Healthier and happier life",
  "feature-4-description": " The benefits you get from exercising and taking care of yourself are not only physical. They affect all areas of your life. You'll have better health, be in a better mood and have better relationships.",
  "feature-5-title": "Increase in your confidence",
  "feature-5-description": " When you start your fitness journey, you're breaking mental barriers. You know what you want and you go for it. By improving a little in each session you feel more capable of fulfilling any desire.",
  "feature-6-title": "Respect from others",
  "feature-6-description": " You'll be perceived by others as someone who takes care of themselves and is in control of their life. They'll see you better, treat you better and respect you more.",
